## Audience
Autistic children aged 5-9 years old

## Problems
Autistic children are recommended to receive 25 hours a week of therapy but are unable to get that amount
This may hinder their progress in cognitive and social functions

## Solution
A platform allowing these children to practise social skills even without guidance of therapists
Improving cognitive and social functions through sensory blocks connected to a digital interface,
to teach them ways to conduct themselves in unfamiliar yet common social situations they may face

Our solution can be compared to building a bridge, slowly teaching autistic children how to interact and connect
with the people around them

## Assumptions
Children have to be able to read and form simple sentences
Children should be able to follow routine and understand how the storyline works

## Unique Selling Point
Our version will succeed because it allows the children to put what they learn into practise and uses
positive reinforcement to ensure that they continue to practise what they do in the storyline, in real life

## Competitors
Sensory Building Blocks, MakerBloks, Social Stories Creator, StoryMaker, Boardmaker
Our product is non-expensive and more accessible
Specific to special needs children
Does not just allow children to read, but interact and be involved in the social story
